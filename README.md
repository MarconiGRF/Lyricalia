- Guess the song (not implemented)
    - Using commonly saved songs between the players, randomly picks songs and their lyrics, giving the players complete sections of the lyrics, the player that guesses the song name & artist faster and more accurately wins more points!
- Random-time challenges (not implemented)
    - In a group of players, a challenge to either complete the lyrics or guess the song will appear in a random time of the day, the player that answers faster and morre accurately wins more points!

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
- [x] Implement client-agnostic API
- [x] Implement an Android Client
- [x] Implement Spotify library support
- [ ] Implement an iOS Client
- [ ] Implement Apple Music library support
- [ ] Implement a Discord Activity Client
- [ ] Implement a Web Client
- [ ] Implement YT Music library support

## Remarks ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **This code is implemented as proof of concept, it by no means have the best code patterns or proper security-safe implementations due to numerous constraints.**
- You have to deploy the API in order to make the clients communicate properly
- The API must have a lyrics database modelled such as [lrclib](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrclib).
